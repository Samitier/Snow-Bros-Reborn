<p>When the evil King Scorch freezes Prince Tom and Prince Nick in their tracks and kidnaps the beautiful princess, the brothers (now snowmen) must break the spell and track down their nemesis for a final showdown. Based on the popular arcade game of the same name, SNOW BROTHERS sends you through 50 massive levels of crazy obstacles and difficult bosses. You'll have to fire snowballs at your enemies to encase them in snow, and then roll your rivals around using them as weapons against the other foes that are trying to put an end to your quest. After each boss character you face you'll get a roll of the slot machine, which can yield free lives or extra points. There's a little something for everyone in this inventive classic (description from <a href="http://www.ign.com/games/snow-bros-jr-166838/gb-5976">IGN</a>.</p>

<a id="the-remake" class="anchor" href="#the-remake" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Remake</h3>

<p>We've created a simple remake of the game with improved graphics and new mechanics to practise with OpenGl, c++ and game development/level design. All the sprites and images are from the original GB game, even though we modified them to give them more resolution. The music and sounds are from the original Snow Bros game and from <a href="http://www.bfxr.net/">BFXR</a>.
There is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5m4ixkeEX0">a video on youtube </a> showing our small project.
Feel free to contribute with whatever you want!</p>
